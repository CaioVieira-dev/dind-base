## My devcontainer with DinD
This is my little “devcontainer” with Docker inside docker(DinD). 
Before opening it in a devcontainer, create an “.env” file and run the script ".devcontainer/utils/generate-certs.sh" to create the certificates for the tls connection to docker

## Use these files however you like
I spent a lot of time creating these files with the help of some AIs, and I hope you won't get as frustrated as I did
